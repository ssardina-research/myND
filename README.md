# myND FOND Planner

An improved codebase for the [myND](https://github.com/robertmattmueller/myND) non-deterministic planner (2010).

## Build

The system requires:

* Java JDK 8:
  * [junit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/). Obtained via Maven but also available under `lib/` (for manual compile).
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for building the system (and further development, if needed).
* Python 3.6+ for [translator-fond](/translator-fond/) and [translator-pond](/translator-pond/) tools to translate FOND/POND PDDL files to SAS.

> [!NOTE]
> Library [args4j](https://args4j.kohsuke.org/) is used but not via a Maven dependency. Instead its source code is copied and extended to have groups of options and hidden options.

Get the dependencies in Linux as follows:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven
```

To build it, first set-up `JAVA_HOME` to Java 8:

```shell
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/ 
$ mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  # build!
```

The above will produce JAR file `target/mynd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and all executable classes in `target/classes`.

> [!WARNING]
> Maven will **not** compile the system with Java 17+ (Open JDK). Still it seem to *run* with Java 17+ once compiled (last test run with Java 21.0.6)

## Run it

The easiest way to use the planner is via its entry shell script `mynd`:

```shell
$ ./mynd -h 
```

The script already includes:

* Java options `-Xmx4g` to set the maximum heap space to 4GB. We could also add `-ea` to enable assertions.
* Usage of new `-translatePath` option to indicate where the Python translators are located. This allows the planner to be called from any directory, not just the root of the planner.

The planner can take SAS encodings or original PDDL domain and problem files. For example, to run over a SAS file and output the solution to file `plan`:

```shell
$ ./mynd data/benchmarks-fond/blocksworld_p10.sas -exportPlan plan
Base dir for myND: /home/ssardina/PROJECTS/planning/FOND/myND.git
java -Xmx4g -cp /home/ssardina/PROJECTS/planning/FOND/myND.git/target/mynd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mynd.MyNDPlanner -translatorPath /home/ssardina/PROJECTS/planning/FOND/myND.git/ data/benchmarks-fond/blocksworld_p10.sas -exportPlan plan

MyND FOND Planner (improved/cleanup version by ssardina - 2022)

Heuristic: FF-heuristic.
Algorithm: LAO*-search
INITIAL IS PROVEN!

Result: Strong cyclic plan found.

Time needed for preprocess (Parsing, PDBs, ...):    0.01 seconds.
Time needed for search:                             0.036 seconds.
Time needed:                                        0.046 seconds.
Total Garbage Collections: 1
Total Garbage Collection Time: 0 seconds.

Out of 58 nodes, 19 are proven
Number of node expansions: 19
Policy entries: 10
Number of sensing applications in policy: 0
Plan file: plan
```

An example using PDDL files as input:

```shell
$ ./mynd -type FOND -search LAOSTAR -heuristic FF  \
    data/fond-pddl/blocksworld/domain.pddl data/fond-pddl/blocksworld/p10.pddl
```

Note that this will call the Python translator, whose output will be reported.

## Options available

Use `-h`  to get the list of options available.

We do not print help manually as in the original planner, which means options are not grouped. The (original) groups is as follows:

## Improvements

- [haz's fork](https://github.com/haz/myND) adapted the codebase to be able to compile/run it under newer Java version (Java 8).
- [ssardina's fork](https://github.com/ssardina-planning/myND) fixed bugs with arguments, added option `--translatorPath`, and a script `myND` to run the planner from any directory. Also improved the README.
